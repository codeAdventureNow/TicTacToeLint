# Tic Tac Toe 
<br>
Initially, I thought creating a Tic Tac Toe app would be straightforward after completing a React Calculator. However, I was mistaken. The complexity increased when I decided to implement a computer player. During the project, I had a breakthrough in working with reducers, simplifying functions, and utilizing booleans as state toggles. It was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my problem-solving skills and provided insights into state management. I'm proud of the progress made and the lessons learned.

## User Stories
&check;  I can choose my team to be 'X' or 'O'.

&check;  I can play Tic Tac Toe against the computer.

&check;  I can see a display of who is the winner or if it is a tie game at the end.

&check;  I can reset the game in the middle of playing or at the end with the click of a button.

## Lessons Learned
- Simplifying state management with a reducer

- How to have the computer randomly choose squares that gradually decrease with each move.

- How to useCallback in conjunction with useEffect in React
